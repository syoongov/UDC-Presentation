# Research Question
.large[
### 1. How is the correctional population spatially distributed across neighborhoods in Utah?

### 2. What are the neighborhood risks associated with the correctional population?
]

???
Presenter notes:
- Emphasize spatial variation
- Focus on risk factors
- Consider policy implications

# Why does this matter for policy research? 

#### Parole population in UT (and nationwide) has been facing a particular large increase due to technical violations and increases in new crimes for non-violent/drug possession related crimes. Since 2012, the probation population increased by 17.8 percent and 47.1 percent for the parole population due to a significant increase in admissions. Moreover, probation revocations grew by 42 percent and parolee revocations grew by 42 percent between 2015 and 2018. 

### More effective resource allocation decisions with scarce budgets!

# Literature Review

.large[
1. Simes (2021) - [Punishing Places](https://www.ucpress.edu/books/punishing-places/paper)
   * Extensive study examining neighborhood effects on incarcerated individuals. First to conceptualize "punishment vulnerability" embedded in place. 
   
2. Sampson, R. J. (2012) - [Great American City: Chicago and the Enduring Neighborhood Effect.](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo220538022.html)
   * Neighborhoods social cohesion shape long term outcomes and spatial inequality. Links neighborhood effects to mass incarceration.

3. Chetty et al. (2018) - [The Opportunity Atlas: Mapping the Childhood Roots of Social Mobility](https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/25147.html#refs)
    * Places  with high rates of poverty, single-parent households, and lack of exposure to adults who are college-educated causally impact income, health, incarceration, and college attendance outcomes.

4. Simes & Jahn (2022) - [The consequences of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act for police arrests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35020737/)
   * Arrests decreased with Medicaid expansion, 25-41% negative difference in drug arrests in first 3 years.

5. Sharkey et al. (2017) - [Community and the Crime Decline: The Causal Effect of Local Nonprofits on Violent Crime](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122417736289)
   * Every 10 additional organizations focusing on crime and community life in a city leads to a 9 percent reduction in the murder rate, a 6 percent reduction in the violent crime rate, and a 4 percent reduction in the property crime rate.

# Model Specification


### INLA-BYM2 Specification
$$
\begin{aligned}
y_i &\sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_i) \\
\log(\mu_i) &= \log(E_i) + \alpha + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_{ij} + u_i + v_i \\
\text{where:} & \\
u_i &\sim \text{ICAR}(\tau_u, \phi) \\
v_i &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_v^{-1})
\end{aligned}
$$


.pull-left[
### Parameters
- $y_i$: Observed count in area i
- $E_i$: Expected count
- $\alpha$: Intercept
- $\beta_j$: Fixed effects / neighborhood covariates 
]

.pull-right[
### Random Effects
- $u_i$: Spatial structure
- $v_i$: Unstructured
- $\phi$: Mixing parameter

# Benefits of INLA Methods

**Traditional econometric methods (OLS/Maximum Likelihood) give you single "best" estimates. INLA instead tells you about all possible values your parameters could take, with their probabilities. This is particularly useful for policy translation.**

.pull-left[
### INLA BYM2
* Full posterior distributions
  * Estimates actual risk levels for each area while accounting for neighboring areas
* Efficient computation O(n^(3/2))
  * Complex spatial dependencies
* Interpretable spatial parameters
* Direct uncertainty quantification
* Better policy targeting, accurate risk assessment
]

.pull-right[
### Spatial Poisson
* Point estimates only
* Slower computation O(n³)
* Complex parameter interpretation
* Bootstrap required for uncertainty

# Who is your neighbor? 
**Tobler’s First Law of Geography states that: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.**
* We need to establish how neighborhoods in SLCO are spatially connected to one another: Neighborhood Weight Matrix (queen contiguity)

# Relative Risk: Air Pollution
*** Relative Risk values > 1, this means there is higher risk than expected. Areas with higher RR values likely have more Diesel Particulate Matter than expected. 
*** 2.42 in Carbon County, then there is 142% more correctional population than expected. Or a place like Morgan county is 0.21 RR has 79% lower correctional population than expected which likely represents an area with better air quality.
